<H1>Configuring Sphere Composition</H1>

<P>Ferret supports integrating many different sources of information
about a program in order to provide better answers to conceptual
queries.  This is accomplished by composing these sources, or
<EM>spheres</EM>, in a principled manner.  The composition is
specified through the Ferret Sphere Configuration Wizard.  This
wizard is automatically invoked when Ferret is first used, and can
be explicitly summoned through Ferret view menu (<IMG
SRC="view-menu.gif">).  Each instance of Ferret (such as occurs
when using multiple windows) is configured separately.</P>

<P>There are five different ways to <A HREF="#Composing_Spheres">compose
spheres</A>.  But to appreciate this requires a small digression
into the meaning of a sphere.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Sphere_Definition">Spheres</A></H3>

<P>A <EM>sphere</EM> is a simple formalism based on the relational
algebra to provide a unified view of any source providing information
about a software system.  A sphere has a set of elements that it
knows about, and describes a set of relations between those elements.</P>

<P>The following are examples of spheres:</P>
<DL>
<DT> Static Java sphere: </DT>
<DD> <EM>Elements:</EM> classes, interfaces, fields, methods.<BR>
    <EM>Relations</EM> extends, implements, calls, accesses,
    overrides. </DD>

<DT>Dynamic Java runtime sphere:</DT>
<DD> <EM>Elements:</EM> classes, methods.<BR>
    <EM>Relations:</EM> calls, instantiates.</DD>

<DT>Plug-in Development:</DT>
<DD> <EM>Elements:</EM> plug-ins, extension points, extensions.<BR>
    <EM>Relations:</EM> specifies, extends.

</DL>

<P>The sphere describes the structure of the source of information,
listing the types of information elements available, and the types
of relations that may exist between these elements.  Each sphere
is reified in one or more fact bases.  Spheres can be thought of
like a database schema, and the fact bases are like individual databases
structured according to that schema.</P>

<P>Some spheres may only have a single factbase, such as the static
Java sphere, which corresponds to the version of the source code
being editted.  Other spheres may have multiple fact bases, such
as the dynamic Java sphere which creates a separate fact base for
each trace.</P>

<H3><A NAME="Composing_Spheres">Composing Spheres</A></H3>

<P>Given that spheres may have some relations in common, we need
some way to identify which sphere's relations should have precendence.
This is specified using <EM>composition functions</EM> to compose
the spheres.  We have identified five different functions for
composing spheres:</P>

<DL>

<DT> replacement: </DT>
<DD>  The composed spheres are tried in order until the first matching
    relation is found.</DD>

<DT> union: </DT>
<DD>  returns the results of the relation on each of the composed sphere.</DD>

<DT> intersection:</DT>
<DD>  returns the result of intersecting the results from relation
    on each of the composed spheres. </DD>

<DT> disjuction (symmetric difference):</DT>
<DD>  returns the results that are not in common between the relation
    on each of the composed spheres. </DD>

<DT> difference: </DT>
<DD>  returns the results from the first sphere that are not returned
    by any of the other subsequent spheres.</DD>

</DL>

<P>A typical composition is using replacement on spheres of
different types, such as:</P>
<PRE>
  {replacement}
  |
  +--> PDE
  |
  +--> {union}
  |      |
  |      +--> Dynamic JDT from trace-1
  |      |
  |      +--> Dynamic JDT from trace-2
  |
  +--> Static JDT
</PRE>

<P>In this example, each sphere is tried in order until a sphere is
found providing the desired relation.</P>
