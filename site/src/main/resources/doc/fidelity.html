<H2>Fidelity of Mappings</H2>

<P>Ferret supports integrating different source of information of
a program, such as the static information and run-time information.
We call these sources of information a <EM>sphere</EM>.  But a
particular element from one sphere may not have a perfect correspondance
to any single element in a different sphere. 
For example, what might a Java interface (from the static
JDT sphere) correspond to when considering the program's run-time
behaviour?</P>

<P>Ferret's model supports different <EM>fidelities</EM> of
correspondance for elements between different spheres.  The fidelity
describes the degree of information preservation in the conversion.
Ferret provides three levels of fidelity:</P>
<DL>
<DT> Exact: </DT>
<DD> Indicates a perfect one-to-one and onto correspondence.
    For example, a class' method from a static Java tool will will
    correspond exactly to the same method from a dynamic runtime
    tool, assuming the dynamic run-time was taken from the same
    source base.  </DD>


<DT> Equivalent: </DT>
<DD> Indicates a very near match: there is no perfect conversion,
    but the elements are felt to be equivalent.
    For example, the conversion of an Java interface will have an
    equivalent correspondence to its implementing classes in in the
    dynamic run-time. </DD>

<DT> Approximate: </DT>
<DD> Indicates an imperfect match, where there is a similarity between
    the elements of the two spheres, but with some differences.
     For example, a representation of a method whose source has been
     modified will have only an approximate correspondence to that
     method from a particular version of a file.</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The fidelities are propagated across queries: if the query element
has an imperfect correspondance to its equivalent in a different
sphere, then any queries from that other sphere must be at least
as imperfect.  </P>
