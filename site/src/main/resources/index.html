<P>Ferret is a tool aimed to help developers during exploration of
software codebases.  Ferret provides a new Eclipse view that provides a
structured display of information describing how one or more  program
elements are situated in the context of the system.
This context is computed automatically as the program elements are
selected in the IDE, and is structured as answers to a set of
<EM>conceptual queries</EM> about those elements.  <P>

<P> Ferret's conceptual queries include and build-on the standard
queries supported by Eclipse. 
These conceptual queries include queries
such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Where is this method called?
<LI> What methods return objects of this type?
<LI> Where are objects of this type instantiated?
<LI> What interfaces define (or specify) this method?
<LI> What implementations are there of this interface method?
<LI> What are the other alternative implementations of this method in
    the hierarchy?
</UL>
<P>More notable is that Ferret's conceptual
queries can make use of different sources of program information,
such as the static relations embedded in the source code, the
dynamic runtime information recorded in a TPTP trace, and
plugin details as defined in <TT>plugin.xml</TT> and <TT>MANIFEST.MF</TT>.
Thus dynamic runtime information can be used to replace
some of the statically-derived relations, transforming the questions
above to "Where are objects of this type <EM>actually</EM> instantiated?"
or "Where is this method <EM>actually</EM> called?"</P>


<P>The conceptual queries are categorized by whether they involve
<EM>declarations</EM>, are about <EM>inter-class</EM> or <EM>intra-class</EM>
relations, or are <EM>hierarchical</EM> in nature.</P>

<P>The results of queries may be clustered by their different
attributes, as selected by the programmer.  For example: the references
to a method, which are generally themselves methods, may be clustered
into different groups identified by attributes such as their access
protection (public, private, package, or default), their containing
type, their package, or boolean attributes such as static vs
non-static.</P>

<P>The Ferret documentation ships with the plugin, and is also available 
<a href="doc/">online</a>.</P>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<p>Ferret is an Eclipse plug-in and requires Eclipse 4.6 (Neon) or
later.  To install, use the following update site:</p>

<P><STRONG>Updates:</STRONG> 
<UL>
<LI> Dec 2009: I rebuilt Ferret to correct for a bug in the PDE sphere. 
    Unfortunately I don't have time to rebuild the TPTP and Kenyon
    spheres, so they are not included at this time.</LI>
<LI> Jan 2010: Ferret uses Apache's <TT>commons-lang</TT>, which wasn't
    declared or included.  This causes breakage when using Ferret in
    the e4 compatibility environment.  Added as a dependency to the
    feature, and rebuilt.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Note:
You may find references to Ariadne in the Ferret source code.
Ferret was formerly named Ariadne, but was renamed so as
to not be confused with another Eclipse plug-in called
<A HREF="http://awareness.ics.uci.edu/~ariadne/">Ariadne</A>.
